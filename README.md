# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
This project is a simple number-guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Players are limited by a set number of attempts and can play multiple rounds, with their score being tracked based on the number of attempts or rounds won.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- **User Input**: The user is prompted to guess the generated number.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, the game provides feedback to let the user know whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- **Limited Attempts**: Users are allowed a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Players can play multiple rounds, with a new random number generated for each round.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks and displays the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts used or rounds won.
